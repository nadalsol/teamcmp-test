# Overview

We would like you to code a single responsive page without any backend. Below are the specs, followed by the design.

## Specs

* The design consists of 3 "views" small (320px to 640px), medium (641px to 1024px), large (1025px and above)
* The page content doesn't expand above 1400px and the minimum supported width is 320px
* On small view:
  ** The header stays always visible at the top of the page
  ** Clicking the download button reveals the download options menu/dropdown
  ** Clicking the "burger" menu reveals the navigation links
* All the links point to "#"
* Page should look acceptable on IE10/IE11.
* The page font is Roboto
* Element spacing doesn't have to be pixel perfect but it should be close to the design
* Social media icons can be replaced with different ones

# Design

You can find the design for the different views and interactions in the /design folder

# Assets

You can find all the design assets in the /assets folder

# Other

* Please don't use any libraries or frameworks (jquery, bootstrap, angular, react)
* Please don't use any front-end template engines
* Usage of bundlers, CSS preprocessors and task runners is encouraged
* Please provide a short summary detailing anything you think is relevant, for example:
  ** Installation steps
  ** How to run your code
  ** What would you have done differently if you had had more time
  ** Etc.
* Please send your results as a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle).

## Evaluation

When evaluating your test, the following things are especially important to us:

* How did you organize your CSS? Ideally, we'd like to see some methodology such as BEM.
* No HTML duplication for different views.
* Is the code "production ready"?
* Is your solution compatible with at least two rendering engines (let us know which ones they are).
